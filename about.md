# Mustafa Yasir

I'm a research assistant in the [AI for Cyber Defence (AICD) Lab](https://www.turing.ac.uk/aicd) at the Alan Turing Institute, advised by [Chris Hicks](https://chrishicks.io/) and [Vasilious Mavroudis](https://mavroud.is/). Our lab aims to solve computer security and privacy problems using autonomous decision making, a goal which requires cooperation between human operators and autonomous systems. 

Consequently, my research focuses on human-machine teaming, or cooperative AI, and sits at the intersection of game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm focused on using elements of game theory, such as social dilemmas, to model and improve cooperation between machines (deep reinforcement learning agents) and people. 

Prior to joining AICD, I got my bachelors in discrete mathematics at Warwick and worked on graph learning for my undergraduate dissertation. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/) at Warwick along with [Bryan Perozzi](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rZgbMs4AAAAJ&hl=en), [John Palowitch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fguoChwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Anton Tsitsulin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hssTYQMAAAAJ) at Google Research to work on their GNN-benchmarking suite, GraphWorld.
