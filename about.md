title: About 
---

Hey, my name is Mustafa (Moose). I've been studying [Discrete Mathematics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/admissions/undergraduate/dm/) at the University of Warwick for the past few years and my motivations behind this blog come from exactly that.

I'm a big believer in the idea that my degree, for better or worse, has completely redesigned the way I process the world around me - through aggressive development in the areas of logic and reason, combined with equal regression in the skills of literacy and nuance. 

This blog is an attempt to work on this imbalance and provide some form of entertaintment to myself and those around me in the process. Simultaneously, this blog is an attempt at displaying <em>(to friends? family? employers?)</em> the unlikely perspectives obtained by drip-brewing the world through a subtly mathematical coffee-filter.

### What am I going to write about?

I've got a few ideas in the works mostly focused around the cool and not so cool things I've done in my past few years at University, what I've learned and so on. Despite how dry and overdone that sounds, I'd like to try spice things up by ensuring everything is guided by <strong>3 golden pillars</strong> that have plagued my undergraduate mathematical life: <strong>non triviality</strong>, <strong>succintesss</strong> and <strong>validity</strong>. 

Although such terms are normally found alongside instructions on constructing formal proofs, I think there is much entertainment to be had from having these principles guide disucssions into much more than Mathematics! Hence the name and description of this blog.
