### Why?

Hey, my name is Mustafa (Moose). I've just graduated in [Discrete Mathematics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/admissions/undergraduate/dm/) from the University of Warwick and my motivations behind this blog come from my envy of the highly literate people I've met along the way.

I'm a big believer in the idea that my degree, for better or worse, has hardwired the way I process the world around me - through aggressive development in the areas of logic and reason, combined with equal regression in the skills of literacy and nuance. This blog is an attempt to work on this imbalance and provide some form of entertaintment to myself and those around me in the process. 

### What?

I'm not sure. I just want to get better at writing really. I'd like this to sound like a stream-of-consciousness interview with myself, purposely hyperlinked on my CV to give prospective employers a more expressive picture of myself. 

If I ever do a PhD (I'm considering) or become a highly accomplished engineer, I may craft this into a much more professional, minimalist style showcase describing my technical passions and interests. For now however, I don't have enough clout to brand myself using 7 vague words in irritably small print, concentrated against the backdrop of a dynamic network animation (you know the type of site, I hope).

### Who?

No personal blog-site of a CS graduate today is complete without a lengthy, humble-brag of highly selected achievements and awards (*I'll  try make it interesting*). 

Here is a text-based highlight reel of my life so far:

* I grew up in the Middle East, between Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, before moving to Scotland at 14 years old.
* I did a gap-year working in cafes, bars, hotels and eventually the Civil Service, to save up for a trip across South East Asia where I **climbed [Mera Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mera_Peak) (6646m)** via the North Face.
* I landed at **Warwick** in 2019, enticed by their unique blend of Mathematics and Computer Science in the fashionably titled '**Discrete Mathematics**' degree. 
* I did some 'Spring Weeks' at **J.P Morgan** and **Jane Street** over lockdown, an internship at [CodeDay](https://www.codeday.org/) as well as **taught kids to code** at [FunTech](https://funtech.co.uk/).
* I interned remotely at **Google** in 2021 and went to the beautiful city of Dublin in 2022 to intern with them once more.
* I did an **intercalated year** at **PA Consulting**, digital nomadded around Spain and Morocco and **climbed Mount Toubkal (4167m)**.
* I kickstarted a project with Google Research in my final year, **published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08881)** to a [KDD workshop](https://graph-learning-benchmarks.github.io/glb2023) and graduated in 2023.
* I **backpacked across the Phillipines** after graduating, presented my paper at [KDD23](https://kdd.org/kdd2023/) in Los Angeles and went on a **1300 mile train journey** across the west coast to Seattle.


__Let's talk!__ If you've stumbled upon this page I already want to know about you and who you are. I only loathe unfamiliar LinkedIn requests when they lead to nothing at all; not even a slightly awkward, transactional phone call where we dance around the elephant of referrals and how best to exploit each other. Hence, do get in [touch](mailto:mustafa.y36@gmail.com) for a chat.



<!-- ### What am I going to write about?

I've got a few ideas in the works mostly focused around the cool and not so cool things I've done in my past few years at University, what I've learned and so on.
