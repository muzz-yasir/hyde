title: About 
---

Hey, my name is Mustafa (Moose). I've been studying [Discrete Mathematics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/admissions/undergraduate/dm/) at the University of Warwick for the past few years and my motivations behind this blog come from exactly that.

I'm a big believer in the idea that my degree, for better or worse, has completely redesigned the way I process the world around me - through aggressive development in the areas of logic and reason, combined with equal regression in the skills of literacy and nuance. 

This blog is an attempt to work on this imbalance and provide some form of entertaintment to myself and those around me in the process. 

<!-- ### What am I going to write about?

I've got a few ideas in the works mostly focused around the cool and not so cool things I've done in my past few years at University, what I've learned and so on.
