# Mustafa Yasir

I'm a research assistant at the Alan Turing Institute, in the AI for Cyber Defence Lab, advised by [Chris Hicks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUeDpN4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Vasilious Mavroudis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUeDpN4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on human-machine teaming, or cooperative AI, and sits at the intersection of game theory and multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning. I'm currently interested in using elements of game theory, such as social dilemmas, to model and improve cooperation between machines (deep reinforcement learning agents) and people.
