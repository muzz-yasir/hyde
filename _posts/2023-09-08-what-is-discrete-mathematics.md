title: What is this thing called 'Discrete Mathematics'?
---

The title of my undergraduate degree never fails to raise questions, overused jokes and all sorts of comments. Many coursemates I know resort to simply saying: "*Maths*", "*CS*" or something in-between, depending on whom we are trying to impress. 

Many conversations have been had throughout my degree on the relative (marginal) merits of placing "*Discrete Mathematics*" or "*Mathematics and Computer Science*" on our CVs: "*What if the recruiters don't think we fit the STEM requirement*", or "*No, the obscurity is an attraction that is to be explained through an invite to interview*" and so on. 

Hence, as my first blog post, I will take on the task of answering the question: *What is Discrete Mathematics?* Read on for a mediocre description of the technicalities, heavily biased by my love of Graphs.

### What is it not? 
Quiet maths, shy maths or any other unfunny word play along those lines. 

### What is it on paper?

In regards to the actual field, Discrete Mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered 'discrete'. There isn't necessarily a hard definition of what this entails, so it's best understood as the complement of 'continuous' mathematical structures: think integers, graphs and logic, as opposed to real numbers, calculus and Euclidean geometry. 

Interestingly, this distinction is only a very recent one: since the time of Isaac Newton and the birth of calculus, the emphasis of applied mathematics has been on continuously varying processes, modeled by the continuum of real numbers and methods dervied from the differential and integral calculus.

In contrast, the significance of discrete structures, and their connections to Computer Science, emerged from the rise of machines which operate in 'discrete' steps and store data in 'discrete' bits (computers). Whereas calculus can be considered to have been born from the womb of the Newton and the apple incident, the first discrete mathematics problem undoubtedly came from Euler and his seven bridges.

#### Euler and his bridges

Here, Euler was concerned with determining whether or not one could take a circular walk through the city of Königsberg, which was divided by a river into four landmasses connected by seven bridges, by crossing each bridge exactly once.

<!-- Euler proved that there is infact no path that does not cross each bridge exactly once, by abstracting the problem into the mathematical structure of a graph - a simple structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, where the landmasses form the nodes and the bridges connect these nodes with edges. In order to do so, he proved that for any graph that we can think of, such an (Eulerian) path only exists when the graph meets certain criteria, specifically: when every node has an even number of edges connected to it.  -->

Euler's triumph in cracking this problem wasn't just a solution to a geographical lunchtime conundrum; it was a bold leap into the world of abstract mathematics. He didn't just study bridges and riverbanks; he unveiled the beauty of mathematical structures – graphs – incredibly simple structures consisting of nodes, the landmasses, connected by a number of edges, bridges. 

In his solution, Euler laid down the rules: for such a path to exist in **any graph**, every node must have an even number of edges. It was a revolutionary shift – from the specifics of Königsberg's geography to the realm of abstract structures. Euler didn't care about the exact location of bridges; he cared about their connections, and it is that insight that best encapsulates the field of Discrete Mathematics.

Euler's recognition that the key information about the problem was the discrete, generalisable variables of the number of bridges, landmasses and their connections, rather than their exact positions and geometry, marked a shift towards studying the abstract structures of problems rather than their real world realisations. 

#### Significance

I mention this problem because it underlines the philosophy of problems in discrete mathematics: it's a discipline that is intimately tied to the meta-problem of problem solving, which thrives on abstraction, imagination, and unconventional thinking. In the world of discrete math, problems aren't bound by reality; they're playgrounds for the mind, where bridges can be lines on paper, and nodes can be anything from friends on a social network to cities on a map.

Whilst this simple formulation birthed the entire field of Graph Theory - a foundational branch of Discrete Mathemtics, it only takes a few hundred years of technological breakthroughs to see how important discrete structures are in enabling machine-oriented modern life.

### What is it in a university degree?

I began writing this and found myself slipping into an entire review of my degree and my life over the past four years, before realising that it probably deserves its own post entirely.
